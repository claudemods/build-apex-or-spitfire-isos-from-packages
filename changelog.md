## v1.0 - 17-11-2025

- solid base but needs work
- lots of testing has gone into making this a thing its 95% and in theory should just work
- ive added all commands that need to be a thing the last time i tested the whole system installed fine to the folder i set
- but this was without squashfs creation commands iso creation commands and extra calamares commands that ive added
- their is 1 file i need to add for calamares e.g mount.conf for btrfs level 22 compression and i will be changing my iso theme for the isos
- i will be up in morning todo this but for now why not try yourself if you want just use install command at bottom of this github repo
